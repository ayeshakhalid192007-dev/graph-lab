# Graph Engineering Course — Docs

This directory is the whole course. Everything readable on GitHub and everything rendered by the companion website is generated from these same markdown files — there is exactly one copy of the content, not two that can drift apart.

If you haven't been here before, don't start on this page. Visit [the router](00-start-here/README.md) first and answer a couple of quick questions about where you're coming from; it will point you at the right entry point below.

## Two ways through the material

**The core path (roughly two hours).** Steps 1 through 13, plus Projects 1 through 4. This gets you from "I have one loop and one memory file" to "I can build a fact graph, feed a worker a bounded slice of it, and check a claim against real edges instead of trusting how confident it sounds." Most readers stop here on a first pass and that's a complete, useful stopping point.

**The second read.** Steps 14 through 17, Projects 5 through 8, the full pattern library, and the advanced tier. This is where governance, scale, and the judgment calls about when *not* to build a graph live. Come back for it once the core path has had time to sink in, or once you're actually running more than one loop against a shared graph and need the harder material.

## Skill tracks

| Track | Level | Walking in, you already know… | Walking out, you can… | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **G1 · Foundations** | New to graphs | The Loop Engineering vocabulary — heartbeat, spine, maker/checker | Point to the exact moment a lone memory file quits working once a second worker starts touching it, and tell a trail of attempts apart from a store of checked claims | Prerequisites + Foundations + Part 1 |
| **G2 · Practitioner** | Comfortable with the two-graph split | That work-history and facts are different graphs with different jobs | Push a real claim through extraction, resolution, and provenance, then hand a worker a bounded subgraph and check its output against real edges | Parts 2–4 + Projects 2–6 |
| **G3 · Engineer** | Can stand up a single working graph | How one graph is built and read | Connect several loops into a governance graph, and name — and patch — each of the four ways a lone loop quietly goes wrong | Part 5 + Projects 7–8 + pattern library |
| **G4 · Ultra-Pro** | Has shipped a graph already | How to run a graph as production infrastructure | Recognize when a graph is the wrong tool for a job, scale one across a bigger system, and write a new pattern for someone else to reuse | Parts 6–7 + advanced tier + certification |

## Before Part 1

| Section | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| [`00-start-here/`](00-start-here/README.md) | A short router — 2–3 questions that point you at the right starting page |
| [`01-prerequisites/`](01-prerequisites/README.md) | Confirms you have Loop Engineering and Harness Engineering, with recap primers if you want a refresher |
| [`02-foundations/`](02-foundations/README.md) | Vocabulary and mental models this whole course leans on: the [glossary](02-foundations/glossary.md), [mental models](02-foundations/mental-models.md), [the two-graph split](02-foundations/the-two-graphs.md) at an intro level, and [comprehension debt](02-foundations/concepts.md) |

## The 17-step roadmap

Links below point at where Day 2 of this build will place each step's page. Until then they're placeholders for the shape of the course, not live pages — that's expected at this stage of the build.

## Patterns and starter kits

Runnable material lives outside `docs/` at the repo root: [`patterns/`](../patterns/README.md) for the pattern catalog and [`starters/`](../starters/README.md) for clone-and-run kits. Full attribution for every idea this course draws on is in [`resources/sources.md`](../resources/sources.md).

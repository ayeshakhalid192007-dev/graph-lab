description: OpenCode equivalent of the Claude Code check-claim skill and graph-verifier agent -- builds each claim's (change, touches, module) triple, scans the populated graph's edges for that exact subject/predicate/object combination, and independently re-verifies every REJECT's citation

# check-claim (OpenCode)

OpenCode equivalent of this kit's Claude Code pair
(`.claude/skills/check-claim/SKILL.md` +
`.claude/agents/graph-verifier.md`). OpenCode's config doesn't have a
separate subagent file the way Claude Code does, so this single skill runs
in two modes, driven by `opencode.json.example`'s `workflow.steps`: **check**
(find the deciding edge and look it up) and **verify** (the independent
recheck). Both modes read the same `sample-graph.example.json`, so the two
never drift apart on what counts as the deciding edge for a claim.

## Instructions

You are an OpenCode skill implementing the `grounded-triple-checker`
pattern. Which mode you run in is set by the `mode` field in the calling
workflow step (`opencode.json.example`); default to `check` if `mode` is
absent.

### Mode: check

1. Read `sample-graph.example.json` (or whatever `input.graph` in the
   workflow step names) before doing anything else. Parse its `nodes` and
   `edges` arrays.
2. Resolve which claims to check from `input.claim_id`, if given; otherwise
   default to every `claim`-typed node in the graph (this kit's shipped
   scenario ships two: `claim-ch3002-no-license-touch` and
   `claim-ch3047-no-license-touch`).
3. For each claim, assemble the `(about, "touches", forbidden_module)`
   triple directly from the claim node's own `about` and `forbidden_module`
   fields — never the claim's free-text `text` field, and never the named
   change's `description` field. Step 4 walks the graph's edges looking
   for that subject/predicate/object combination.
4. Walk every edge the graph has, looking for one entry where subject,
   predicate, and object all three match that triple at once.
5. Decide the verdict from presence alone: REJECT and cite the matching
   edge if it's present; ACCEPT if it's absent. If the claim's `about` or
   `forbidden_module` id isn't in the graph's nodes at all, report
   UNVERIFIABLE instead of defaulting to ACCEPT.
6. Write `verdicts.json` (or `input.output` if the workflow step names a
   different path): an array with one entry per claim, each holding
   `claim_id`, `about`, `forbidden_module`, `decomposed_edge`,
   `edge_found`, `verdict`, and `citation` (`null` unless the verdict is
   REJECT).
7. Return, alongside the JSON, a printed summary: how many claims landed in
   each verdict bucket, and the citation for every REJECT.

### Mode: verify

This mode does not trust the `check` step's self-reported verdicts or
citations — it independently re-decomposes and re-checks every claim, the
same way the Claude Code `graph-verifier` agent does.

1. Read `sample-graph.example.json` (or `input.graph`) and independently
   parse its `nodes` and `edges`.
2. Read `verdicts.json` (or `input.verdicts`). Fail immediately, with that
   stated as the failure, if it isn't valid JSON or any entry is missing
   `claim_id`, `about`, `forbidden_module`, `edge_found`, or `verdict`.
3. For each entry, confirm its `claim_id` exists as a claim node in the
   full graph and that its `about` / `forbidden_module` match that node's
   own fields exactly. Flag any mismatch or unknown claim_id.
4. Independently re-derive the deciding triple `(about, "touches",
   forbidden_module)` straight from the graph's claim node — not from the
   entry's own `decomposed_edge`.
5. Independently walk the full graph's edges on its own, checking each one
   against that triple.
6. Flag any entry whose `verdict` disagrees with this independent
   presence/absence result — an edge found present paired with ACCEPT, or
   found absent paired with REJECT, is an automatic FAIL for that entry.
7. For every REJECT, confirm its `citation` exists verbatim in the full
   graph and matches the re-decomposed triple exactly. Flag a REJECT whose
   citation is missing, vague, or names a different edge.
8. For every ACCEPT, confirm no matching edge exists anywhere in the full
   graph. Flag any ACCEPT that should have been a REJECT.
9. Check this kit's known scenario answers on unmodified sample data:
   `claim-ch3002-no-license-touch` must be ACCEPT and
   `claim-ch3047-no-license-touch` must be REJECT, citing `(CH-3047,
   touches, drm-license-issuer)`. Flag either one landing the other way.
10. Return a PASS/FAIL report: PASS only if nothing was flagged in steps
    3-9, otherwise FAIL with every flagged item, the rule it broke, and a
    suggested fix.

## Input

- `sample-graph.example.json` — the populated graph.
- check mode: a claim id, or nothing (`input.claim_id`, defaults to every
  claim node).
- verify mode: `verdicts.json` (or the path configured) to check.

## Output

- check mode: `verdicts.json` plus a printed verdict-bucket summary.
- verify mode: a PASS/FAIL validation report listing flagged items, the
  rule each one broke, and a suggested fix — matching the report shape in
  the Claude Code `graph-verifier` agent's Example section.

## Configuration

This skill uses `opencode.json.example`'s `workflow.steps` to know which
mode to run and where to find its input/output files:
- `input.graph` / `input.claim_id` — check mode's full graph and (optional)
  single claim to check.
- `input.verdicts` / `input.graph` — verify mode's verdicts-to-check and
  full graph paths.

## Integration

`check` mode mirrors the Claude Code `check-claim` skill's behavior exactly
(same graph, same decomposition off the claim node's own fields, same
never-read-the-description rule, same UNVERIFIABLE fallback). `verify` mode
mirrors the Claude Code `graph-verifier` subagent's behavior exactly (same
independent re-decomposition, same citation check, same known-scenario
answer check). Running both modes back to back over this kit's
`sample-graph.example.json` should produce the same two verdicts — ACCEPT
for `claim-ch3002-no-license-touch`, REJECT for
`claim-ch3047-no-license-touch` — as the Claude Code version.

# grounded-triple-checker Starter Kit

A runnable starter kit for the **grounded-triple-checker** pattern. Its
worked case is a "this change doesn't touch that module" claim, and the
verdict comes from exactly one source: whether the graph's edge list
already contains a matching subject/predicate/object triple for that
change and module. How convincingly — or how worryingly — the change's
own write-up is worded never factors in. This kit's worked scenario
involves a fictional video-encoding and streaming company ("Cobalt
Stream") and two invented changes against its pipeline — not based on any
real company or codebase.

This is a **read-path** kit, unlike `document-to-facts`,
`alias-merge-with-trail`, and `receipt-per-edge`. There's no document to
extract from and no `schema.example.json` — instead there's
`sample-graph.example.json`, a small, fixed, already-populated graph to
query against.

## The scenario

Two changes land against Cobalt Stream's video pipeline in the same week.
`CH-3002`'s description describes a thumbnail-batching cleanup and claims
it never goes near the DRM license issuer — a module sensitive enough that
a reviewer wants that specific claim double-checked before merging.
`CH-3047`'s description reads just as reassuring: a small subtitle-retry
fix, also claiming no contact with the license issuer. Only one of the two
claims is actually true. `CH-3047` also swaps in a cache helper pulled
straight out of the license module — a detail its own description never
mentions — and the graph, assembled from the diff rather than from either
change's prose, already contains that exact edge.

Read side by side, the two descriptions give no way to tell which claim is
true — both come across just as sure of themselves. This kit's skill
instead asks one narrow question per claim — is there a `touches` edge
linking the named change to `drm-license-issuer` in the graph — and lets
the answer alone decide the outcome: ACCEPT `CH-3002`'s claim, REJECT
`CH-3047`'s, and name the exact edge that gives it away.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code, or OpenCode, or both (this kit ships a working
  implementation for each).
- No external services or API keys — the whole kit runs against the one
  local file described below.

## Quick Start

1. Review `PATTERN.md` to understand what this pattern solves for and what
   breaks without it.
2. Examine `sample-graph.example.json` — the fixed 10-node, 7-edge graph
   this kit queries. Note the two claim nodes, the `drm-license-issuer`
   module they're both about, and the single `touches` edge that separates
   a true claim from a fabricated one.
3. Follow the tool-specific instructions below to run the kit.
4. Inspect `verdicts.json` and confirm it matches the "Expected Output"
   section below — including which claim was REJECTed and the edge cited.

### Claude Code

1. Load the skill: `.claude/skills/check-claim/SKILL.md`.
2. Ask it to run: "Use the check-claim skill on
   sample-graph.example.json." (With no claim id given, it checks every
   claim node in the graph — both of this kit's shipped claims.)
3. It writes `verdicts.json` and prints a summary of each verdict and,
   for any REJECT, the specific edge it cited.
4. Load the verifier: `.claude/agents/graph-verifier.md` and ask it to
   check `verdicts.json` against `sample-graph.example.json`. It
   independently re-decomposes and re-checks each claim rather than trusting
   the check run's own account.

### OpenCode

1. Copy `opencode/opencode.json.example` to `opencode.json` (or point
   OpenCode at it directly).
2. Run the `check` workflow step — it invokes
   `opencode/skills/check-claim/SKILL.md` in check mode over
   `sample-graph.example.json` and writes `verdicts.json`.
3. Run the `verify` workflow step — the same skill file, running in
   verify mode, independently re-checks `verdicts.json` and reports
   PASS/FAIL.

## Expected Output

Running the kit over the shipped graph should produce `verdicts.json` with
two entries:

- **`claim-ch3002-no-license-touch` -> ACCEPT.** Decomposed edge
  `(CH-3002, touches, drm-license-issuer)` is absent from the graph —
  `CH-3002` only touches `thumbnail-renderer` and `cdn-purger`. `citation`
  is `null`.
- **`claim-ch3047-no-license-touch` -> REJECT.** Decomposed edge
  `(CH-3047, touches, drm-license-issuer)` is present in the graph —
  `CH-3047` also touches `subtitle-sync`, but that edge isn't why the
  claim is rejected; the license-issuer edge is. `citation` names that
  exact edge.

`CH-3118`, the unrelated metrics-exporter change, has no claim attached and
should never appear in `verdicts.json` at all.

### Checking the verdicts

Every verdict in this kit should be defensible by pointing at one edge in
the graph — never by describing how safe or risky the change generally
felt. To confirm it:

- Open `verdicts.json` and check `claim-ch3047-no-license-touch`'s
  `citation` names `{"subject": "CH-3047", "predicate": "touches",
  "object": "drm-license-issuer"}` exactly — not a paraphrase, not a
  different edge.
- Confirm `claim-ch3002-no-license-touch`'s `citation` is `null` and its
  `verdict` is ACCEPT.
- Confirm neither verdict was decided by reading either change's
  `description` field — the decomposed edge and the graph's edge list are
  the only inputs that should have mattered.

If `claim-ch3047-no-license-touch` comes back ACCEPT, the checker fell back
to trusting the change's own description instead of the graph — exactly
the failure this kit exists to catch, and the verifier should flag it (see
"Symptom" table below).

## Modifying the Example

To adapt this kit to your own grounded-triple-checker scenario:

1. Replace `sample-graph.example.json` with your own graph — any set of
   nodes and edges works, as long as you keep a way to record a
   change-to-module relationship (this kit uses `touches`) and a way to
   attach a claim about a specific change/module pair (this kit uses
   `claim` nodes with `about` / `forbidden_module` fields, linked to their
   change by a `claims` edge).
2. Add or edit claim nodes to test new scenarios — nothing about the
   decomposition logic is hardcoded to `drm-license-issuer` or Cobalt
   Stream.
3. Re-run the skill and confirm `verdicts.json` still cites a real edge for
   every REJECT and still passes the verifier.

## Architecture

- `PATTERN.md` — what this pattern does, its inputs/outputs, and the
  failure mode if you skip it.
- `sample-graph.example.json` — the fixed 10-node Cobalt Stream graph this
  kit queries (replaces `schema.example.json` for this read-path kit — see
  `starters/README.md`'s anatomy note).
- `.claude/skills/check-claim/SKILL.md` — Claude Code decompose-and-check
  skill.
- `.claude/agents/graph-verifier.md` — Claude Code validation subagent.
- `opencode/opencode.json.example` — OpenCode workflow configuration.
- `opencode/skills/check-claim/SKILL.md` — OpenCode skill covering both
  checking and verification (see its "Mode" sections).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| `verdicts.json` shows ACCEPT for `claim-ch3047-no-license-touch`. | The skill read the change's `description` field instead of searching the graph's edge list — re-check `SKILL.md` step 5 ran the edge search before deciding anything. |
| A REJECT entry has `citation: null` or a citation that doesn't match the decomposed edge. | Step 5 decided REJECT correctly but skipped naming the edge, or named a different one. A REJECT must always cite the exact matching edge, not just assert one exists. |
| A claim comes back ACCEPT when its `about`/`forbidden_module` id isn't even in the graph. | Step 6 was skipped — an unresolvable claim must be reported UNVERIFIABLE, not defaulted to ACCEPT. |
| `verdicts.json` includes an entry for `CH-3118` or any change with no claim node. | Step 2 checked a change directly instead of limiting itself to the claim nodes the graph actually contains. |
| The verifier reports a discrepancy between its independently-derived edge presence and `verdicts.json`'s self-reported `edge_found`. | This is the verifier doing its job — it means the check run got the lookup wrong. Treat `verdicts.json` as untrusted until the discrepancy is resolved. |

## Next Steps

- Review the pattern specification in
  `patterns/grounded-triple-checker.md` in the course repo for the general
  (not scenario-specific) statement of this pattern.
- This is a core kit — see `starters/README.md` for how it relates to the
  other six core kits and the sixteen extended kits.

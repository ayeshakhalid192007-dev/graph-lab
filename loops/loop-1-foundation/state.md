# Loop 1 state — Foundation & Content Pipeline

**Tasks:** 1–4 · **Gate:** `npm run verify:1` · **Status:** not started

Per-task log for this loop. Cross-loop material — gate entries, repairs to earlier loops, decisions binding later loops — goes in `../shared/state.md` instead.

---

## Task log

One entry per completed task, appended as it lands. Template from `../shared/handoff.md`:

```markdown
### Task <n> — <title>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Landed:** what now exists that did not before.
**Files:** created / modified, as paths.
**Produces:** exported symbols and types later tasks import by name.
**Verified by:** the command run, and what it actually printed — a count, a
score, a page total. Not "green".
**Next loop needs to know:** anything non-obvious. Delete if nothing.
```

_No tasks completed yet._

## Blockers

A blocker stops this loop. Record it here, then stop and report — do not invent an answer and do not work around it silently. Blocked ≠ done.

```markdown
### B<n> — <short title>, <date>

**Blocked at:** Task <n>, Step <n>.
**What is needed:** the specific input, decision, or clarification.
**What was tried:** so the user does not repeat it.
**Cannot proceed because:** why guessing would be wrong.
```

_None._

## Notes

Working observations that are not yet handoff material — counts seen, oddities noticed, things to confirm. Anything here that turns out to matter to a later loop gets promoted into a task entry's *Next loop needs to know*, or into `../shared/state.md`.

**Pre-loop baseline, 2026-08-07:** repo directory, git history, `origin` remote, `CLAUDE.md`, `loops/`, and `plan/` all exist before Task 1 begins. See D1 in `../shared/state.md` — Task 1 Step 1 must not re-init git or delete existing files.
